# Parity-Violating Electron Scattering World Data Plot
An IPython notebook used to recontruct an original plot of the world's set of parity-violating electron scattering asymmety measurements. The purpose of this visualization is to show the generational improvement of the precision, or measurement uncertainty, for each successive experiment. The script produces the following plot:

## Usage

This data visualization is constructed in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of future modification. With the IPython notebook software installed, the notebook can be opened with the following command:

```
ipython3 notebook PVeS_Generations_Plot.ipynb
```
